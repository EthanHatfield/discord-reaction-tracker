# Bug Fixes Applied - October 4, 2025

## ‚úÖ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Database Query Bug (CRITICAL)** - `database.py`
**Problem:** The `guild_id` parameter was being overwritten with an empty list, causing the filter to fail.
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
params = [guild_id]
params = []  # ‚ùå This overwrote guild_id!

# AFTER (FIXED):
params: List[Any] = [guild_id]  # ‚úÖ Guild filter now works correctly
```
**Impact:** Reports were potentially showing reactions from all servers or no data at all.

### 2. **Duplicate Docstring** - `tracker.py`
**Problem:** Duplicate docstring in `scan_channel_history` method causing confusion.
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
"""Scan a channel's message history for reactions."""
# ... validation code ...
"""Scan a channel's message history for reactions."""  # ‚ùå Duplicate!

# AFTER (FIXED):
"""Scan a channel's message history for reactions."""
# ... validation code ...
# ‚úÖ Single docstring, clean structure
```

### 3. **Unused Variable** - `tracker.py`
**Problem:** Unused `report` variable declaration.
```python
# BEFORE:
report_lines: List[str] = []
report: List[str] = []  # ‚ùå Unused

# AFTER:
report_lines: List[str] = []  # ‚úÖ Clean code
```

### 4. **Type Hints Improvement** - `database.py`
**Problem:** Incorrect type hints causing linting errors.
```python
# BEFORE:
params = [guild_id]  # Type was implicitly List[int]

# AFTER:
params: List[Any] = [guild_id]  # ‚úÖ Correct type for mixed parameters
```

### 5. **Better Error Handling** - `bot.py`
**Added:** Improved startup error messages and token validation.
- Clear error messages for missing .env file
- Better instructions for configuration
- Graceful error handling for invalid tokens
- Startup information display

## üéØ Testing Recommendations

1. **Test the guild filter:**
   ```
   !report 7 all
   ```
   Should now only show reactions from the current server.

2. **Test emoji filtering:**
   ```
   !report 30 üòπ
   ```
   Should properly filter by the cat emoji.

3. **Check database integrity:**
   ```
   !debug_db
   ```
   (Owner only) Verify database contents are correct.

4. **Verify scanning works:**
   ```
   !scan
   !scan_status
   ```
   Check that scanning completes without errors.

## üìù Additional Notes

- All type hints are now properly configured
- No compilation or lint errors remain
- Code is cleaner and more maintainable
- Error messages are more user-friendly

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Test the bot with these fixes
2. Monitor for any remaining issues
3. Consider adding rate limit protection in `on_reaction_add` event
4. Consider adding a progress bar or better feedback during long scans
